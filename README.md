# Breadth-First-Search

A simple JavaScript program written by me from scratch to print Breadth First Traversal of a graph. Everything is printed in the developers console.

# Assumption
Vertices are labelled from 0 and must contain all the numbers from 0 to SIZE-1. The program can be improved in this aspect by a slight modification, but this is only for my own (and anybody who wishes to revise) reference purpose so it doesn't matter much.

# Disclaimer
- This isn't supposed to be a user friendly program and is targeted towards competitive coding and exams.
- I am not very good at JavaScript. Do not blame me if this program harms your system in any way. I am quite sure, there exist better ways of writing a program with the same functionality.
